				This site contains examples of accessible navigation menus. 
			<h3>Caveats</h3>
			<p> When reviewing these pages, please keep the following aspects in mind:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					These menus have been optimized for accessibility. Some further testing
					with other accessibility experts and assistive technology users is 
					planned, so some features may change.
				</li>
				<li>
					The site contents are currently dynamically generated to provide placeholder
					text. It is fairly easy to change the pages and headings on a page in case
					more relevant categories are needed.
				<li>
					The pages and menus are not currently designed to be responsive as of yet. 
					Performance on smaller screens will have issues. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Many stylistic aspects of the menus can be changed. This includes colors, 
					spacing, icons, etc. Current colors do follow SU branding while allowing
					for accessibility.
				</li>
				<li>
					These examples are for <em>primary</em> site navigation, meaning the 
					main navigation typically at the top of a web page. The placement and
					styling of any secondary navigation can be discussed. The current 
					secondary navigation seen in the right column of some pages is merely
					a placeholder for now.
				</li>
				<li>
					All pages do have <em>Breadcrumb</em> navigation when appropriate. This
					is recommended for accessibility purposes.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="menus">Menus</h2>
			<p>
				For each menu type, a brief description is provided including interaction 
				features. Benefits and drawbacks are also provided.
			<p>
			<h3>Flat Menu</h3>
			<p>
				The <a href="flat-menu.html
			
			
			<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
			<p> 
				The code for theses individual menu schemes were written to be fairly barebones
				and independent of existing libraries. The individual menu options will have 
				their code separated into distinct codebases in the near future.
			<p>
			<h3>Site Generation</h3>
			<p>
				Mention YAML file here.
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>Resources</h3>
			<p>
				The following resources were used in designing the menus:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adrian Roselli's code</li>
				<li>WAI-ARIA authoring practices</li>
			</ul>
