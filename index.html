				This site contains examples of accessible navigation menus. 
			</p>
			<h3>Caveats</h3>
			<p> When reviewing these pages, please keep the following aspects in mind:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					These menus have been optimized for accessibility. Some further testing
					with other accessibility experts and assistive technology users is 
					planned, so some features may change.
				</li>
				<li>
					The site contents are currently dynamically generated to provide placeholder
					text. It is fairly easy to change the pages and headings on a page in case
					more relevant categories are needed.
				<li>
					The pages and menus are not currently designed to be responsive as of yet. 
					Performance on smaller screens will have issues. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Many stylistic aspects of the menus can be changed. This includes colors, 
					spacing, icons, etc. Current colors do follow SU branding while allowing
					for accessibility.
				</li>
				<li>
					These examples are for <em>primary</em> site navigation, meaning the 
					main navigation typically at the top of a web page. The placement and
					styling of any secondary navigation can be discussed. The current 
					secondary navigation seen in the right column of some pages is merely
					a placeholder for now.
				</li>
				<li>
					All pages do have <em>Breadcrumb</em> navigation when appropriate. This
					is recommended for accessibility purposes.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2 id="menus">Menus</h2>
			<p>
				For each menu type, a brief description is provided including interaction 
				features. Benefits and drawbacks are also provided.
			<p>
			
			<h3>Flat Menu</h3>
			<p>
				The <a href="flat-menu.html?&page=Home">Flat Menu</a> is the most basic 
				navigation menu. The navigation only contains links to the top-most pages. 
			</p>
			<details class="menu-type">
				<summary>Features, Benefits, and Drawbacks</summary>
				<h4>Features</h4>
				<p><em>None</em></p>

				<h4>Benefits</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Simple implementation. 
					</li>
					<li>
						No accessibility fixes needed beyond proper semantic HTML.
					</li>
					<li>
						Does not require JavaScript and can work on older browsers.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Drawbacks</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Requires every top-level page, if appropriate, to have a 
						sub-navigation menu.
					<li>
						Users cannot discover site structure without clicking.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users must rely on memory of site structure or site search.
					</li>
					<li>
						Desire to improve discoverability of site often leads to 
						more links in the menu, which makes it harder to support
						in smaller screens.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			
			<h3>Dropdown-Only Menu</h3>
			<p>
				The <a href="dropdown-only-menu.html?&page=Home">Dropdown-Only Menu</a> 
				uses a dropdown/disclosure widget to show a sub-menu of pages. This
				variant places all links (save Home) under a submenu triggered by a
				button.
			</p>
			<details class="menu-type">
				<summary>Features, Benefits, and Drawbacks</summary>
				<h4>Features</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Meets expected interaction options for accessiblity:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Toggle button can be triggered by touch, click, <kbd>space</kbd>
								key, <kbd>enter</kbd> key, or <kbd>&darr;</kbd> (down arrow) key.
							</li>
							<li>
								Once the menu is open, users can navigate the submenu via 
								<kbd>tab</kbd>, <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> (up arrow) key, and 
								<kbd>&darr;</kbd> (down arrow) key.
							</li>
							<li>
								An open menu can be closed by the <kbd>Esc</kbd> (escape) key.
								Focus is returned to the menu's toggle button.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Menu closes when the user clicks/touches anywhere outside of the menu
						widget. This is optional and can be removed (not a requirement for
						accessibility but common).
					</li>
					<li>
						The top-level link is the first link in the submenu.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Benefits</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Improved discoverability of site structure.
					</li>
					<li>
						Uses basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ARIA markup supported by
						all modern browsers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Target (i.e., button) sizes are large for easy accessibility.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Drawbacks</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						To get to a top level page, one has to toggle open the menu.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users must understand that the <em>down triangle</em> icon 
						means it is a menu toggle button and not a link.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users might click on button expecting a link.
					</li>
					<li>
						Requires JavaScript and may not work on older browsers although
						the menu will default to a basic flat menu (progressive enhancement).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			
			<h3>Dropdown-Link Menu</h3>
			<p>
					The <a href="dropdown-link-menu.html?&page=Home">Dropdown-Link Menu</a> 
					uses a dropdown/disclosure widget to show a sub-menu of pages. This
					variant keeps the top-level item as a link and then provides a toggle
					button to display a menu of the sub-pages.
			</p>
			<details class="menu-type">
				<summary>Features, Benefits, and Drawbacks</summary>
				<h4>Features</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Meets expected interaction options for accessiblity:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Toggle button can be triggered by touch, click, <kbd>space</kbd>
								key, <kbd>enter</kbd> key, or <kbd>&darr;</kbd> (down arrow) key.
							</li>
							<li>
								Once the menu is open, users can navigate the submenu via 
								<kbd>tab</kbd>, <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> (up arrow) key, and 
								<kbd>&darr;</kbd> (down arrow) key.
							</li>
							<li>
								An open menu can be closed by the <kbd>Esc</kbd> (escape) key.
								Focus is returned to the menu's toggle button.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Menu closes when the user clicks/touches anywhere outside of the menu
						widget. This is optional and can be removed (not a requirement for
						accessibility but common).
					</li>
					<li>
						The top-level link is the first link in the submenu.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Benefits</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Improved discoverability of site structure.
					</li>
					<li>
						Uses basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ARIA markup supported by
						all modern browsers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users do not have to go to the top-level page.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Drawbacks</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Adds an extra tab stop (the toggle button) for each top-level 
						link. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Users must understand that the <em>down triangle</em> icon 
						means it is a menu toggle button and not a link.
					</li>
					<li>
						For accessibility, the toggle button needs to be of a minimal size 
						(ideally a little larger than it is currently).
					</li>
					<li>
						Requires JavaScript and may not work on older browsers although
						the menu will default to a basic flat menu (progressive enhancement).
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
			<p> 
				The code for theses individual menu schemes were written to be fairly barebones
				and independent of existing libraries. The individual menu options will have 
				their code separated into distinct codebases in the near future.
			<p>
			<h3>Site Generation</h3>
			<p>
				Each menu variant and its pages are generated dynamically.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The overall site structure is defined in <em>site.yaml</em>, 
					a human-readable YAML file that defines top-level pages, 
					subpages, and H2-level headings on each page.
				</li>
				<li>
					Distinct pages are defined by the URL query parameters 
					<em>page</em> and <em>subpage</em> as defined in the 
					YAML file.
				</li>
				<li>
					Randomized text content was gathered from 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> using this 
					<a href="https://www.boom-online.co.uk/lorem-ipsum/">placeholder 
					text generator</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					To guarantee the same content appears on each page, a 
					<em>seed</em> query parameter is used to prime a pseudorandom
					number generator. The seed is a hash of the concatenation of
					the <em>page</em> and <em>subpage</em> params.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3>Resources</h3>
			<p>
				The following resources were used in designing the menus:
